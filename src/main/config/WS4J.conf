# This is a master list of comments as used in the example configuration
# files found in this directory. This is not intended to be used as a
# configuration file but rather as a plain text summary of possible options
# and their values. In fact, the measures will not accept this as a
# configuration file.
# 
# All of these options have default values that are described below. If an
# option is listed without a value (as in trace:: or cache:: ), then the
# default value is used.
# 
# Note that in the configuration files anything following a # is treated as
# a comment, so the following text can be used directly in a configuration
# file. You will want to make sure to change the value of an option as fits 
# your needs however!

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported for all measures

trace = 0         # Turns off (0) tracing. Turn on tracing by setting
                  # to 1 or 2. The effect of these different levels will
                  # depend on the measure being used. The default value 
                  # is off (0). If the value is omitted, then the default 
                  # is used. 0, 1, and 2 are the only valid settings.

cache = 1         # Turns on (1) caching. Turn off caching by setting 
                  # to 0. The default is on (1). If the value is omitted,
                  # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
                  # settings.

memoryDB = 0      # WordNet DB is loaded on memory when memoryDB (1).
                  # WordNet DB stays on disk when memoryDB (0).

MFS = 0           # Use Most Frequent Sense when (1).
                  # Use all sense combinations when (0). 
                  # MFS increases calculation speed up.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option will be supported by path, lch, 
# wup, res, lin and jcn measure

# rootNode = 1    # Turns on (1) a (hypothetical) top-level root node for
                  # the nouns, and another for the verbs. Turn off the 
                  # root nodes by setting to 0. The default is to use (1) 
                  # a unique top-level root node. If the value is omitted,
                  # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
                  # settings. 
                  # THIS VALUE IS ALWAYS 1 IN CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by res, lin and jcn measure

infoContent = ic-semcor.dat

                  # Specifies the name of an information content file under 
                  # data/. The value of this option must be the name of a
                  # file, or a relative or absolute path name. The default
                  # value of this option ic-semcor.dat.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by lesk measure

stem = 0          # Turns on (1) stemming. Turn off stemming by setting
                  # this value to 0. The default value is off (0). When 
                  # stemming is on (1), all the words in a gloss are stemmed
                  # by the Porter stemmer before overlaps are identified.

stopList = stopList

                  # Specifies the name of a stop list, which consists of
                  # words that are to be ignored in a gloss overlap. The
                  # value of this must be a file name, or an absolute or
                  # relative path name. The default is to not use a stop
                  # list. If the value is omitted, then the default is used.
                  # The default value of this option is stoplist.txt.

leskNormalize = 0 # Turns on (1) normalization of lesk scoring. Turn off
                  # by setting this value to 0. The default value is on 
                  # (1). If the value is omitted, then the default is used. 
                  # When normalization is enabled, the gloss overlap score 
                  # is normalized by the size of the glosses. The details 
                  # are described in Banerjee and Pedersen (2002).
